## I Introduction

Content analyses lay at the core of communication sciences. As only original method of the field [@roessler2017, p. 15] they are especially popular within journalism and mass media communication studies [@frueh2017, p. 15] as such widespread media contents and thus their understanding are enormously important in and for societies [@dgpuk2008].

However, despite its long tradition and inherent entanglement with the development of communication sciences as such [e. g., @frueh2017, pp. 11-12; @brosius_et_al2022, pp. 143-144], there have been, still exist and newly arise several problems regarding a truly knowledge-making and therefore efficient application of the method within in the field, its subdisciplines and beyond. Roughly, these problems can be traced back to three incidential developments over more than at least 50 years of content analytic empirical social research following for example the well-known prime example of Harold D. Lasswell [-@lasswell1941]:

  1. a **wide application spectrum** [e. g., @roessler2017, p. 14; @oehmer_et_al2023a, part II to V],
  2. a tendency to generate **"atheoretical work"** [@evans_et_al1995], and
  3. a **lack of infrastructures** for collaboration, sharing and/or overview [e. g., @heft_et_al2023, pp. 356-357; @oehmer_et_al2023b].
  
While in fact the first characteristic is considered to be a strength of the method, it promotes at the same time the questionable or lacking links between empirical studies and broader theories and hampers the generation of common infrastructures. Consequently, exhausting the methods potentials, as it is currently understood and done, leads to a scattering of empirical studies which also means that the conceptualised operationalisations and the used instruments as well as the achieved findings often remain isolated or only loosely interconnected within the area. This circumstance is not only problematic in terms of efficiency but moreover inconsistent with the scientific principle or claim of cumulative knowledge production [e. g., @freese1972; @parsons1954, p. 350]. This becomes particularly obvious when various content analyses are reviewed under a more general social question than can be typically answered in singular studies. One of these overarching interests directly emerging from the self-conception of the respective research community in Germany to contribute to the explanation of the "reciprocal relationship between communication, media and society" [@dgpuk2008] is the probing question of the relationship between mass media and societal, thus, political decision-making.

In this regard, there are several theories looking at the societal role of (mass) media, such as McCombs and Shaw's [@-mccombs_et_al1972] theory of agenda-setting, the theory of medialisation [e. g., @imhof2006; @meyen2009; @neuberger2016], or the cultivation hypothesis brought forward by Gerbner [e. g., -@gerbner1969] to name a few examples. What most of them have in common is a general constructivist perspective from which mass media constructs a certain type of reality by selection and presentation [e. g., @brosius_et_al1995] and, typically pressuming a functional differentiation of modern societies [see also e. g., @gerhards1991; @schimank2001], shapes a society's shared reality [e. g., @luhmann1995, p. 5]. Furthermore, within in the community it is also (nearly) common sense that media depictions do not just affect the societal environments they are embedded in, but are similarly influenced by them as well. Most of all they depend on information from other societal systems like politics, economy or science, which they acquire through observation of and/or correspondence with representatives (individuals, organisations, institutions) of these other systems. Thus, mass media, particularly traditional journalism, is often, also in this work, conceptualised as "autonomous observer" [@kohring1997, p. 217] of the society. This means that the contents included in media coverage are - in various degrees - simultaneously reflecting and constructing societal processes.

This bidirectional function of mass media is especially valued in democratic societies where media is also oftentimes decribed as "fourth estate" [e. g. @altmeppen_et_al1998]. In this context, it is presumed that many of the media contents are reflecting (and constructing) public exchange between societal actors who are authorised with political power and other societal actors (stakeholders, audience) that (ideally) legitimise their power and the resulting decisions. This normative basis of democracies was especially described by the German sociologist Jürgen Habermas [-@habermas1990; -@habermas1998] who described this mutual negotiation of decisions that affect a whole society between actors in different positions with the term "discourse". Accordingly, media coverage that mirrors or moderates such debates can be described as "media discourse". Thus, analysing not only media content, but understanding public discourses that are reflected in the media are a central interest of many communication scientists.

Nevertheless, as previously indicated, trying to meet this research interest and provide an answer to the overarching question of characteristics of public media discourses is with respect to the current content analytical practices and the resulting scattering and incomparability of existing empirical studies nearly impossible. However, the question is to big (and dynamic) to be answered in one single study or even a whole singular research project. Therefore the here reported PhD project is not aiming at ultimately or preliminary answering this question. Rather, by focussing on the more specific subdomain of technoscientific reporting central to science communication studies as an example, it is devoted to developing a framework for a more comparable and, therefore also, efficient content analytical research on media discourses, including a theoretical basis as well as overarchingly applicable and accessible (partly automated) instruments.
