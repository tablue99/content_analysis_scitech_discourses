# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Content analyses lay at the core of communication sciences. As only original method of the field [@roessler2017, p. 15] they are especially popular within journalism and mass media communication studies [@frueh2017, p. 15] as such widespread media contents and thus their understanding are enormously important in and for societies [@dgpuk2008].

However, despite its long tradition and inherent entanglement with the development of communication sciences as such [e. g., @frueh2017, pp. 11-12; @brosius_et_al2022, pp. 143-144], there have been, still exist and newly arise several problems regarding a truly knowledge-making and therefore efficient application of the method within in the field, its subdisciplines and beyond. Roughly, these problems can be traced back to three incidential developments over more than at least 50 years of content analytic empirical social research following for example the well-known prime example of Harold D. Lasswell [-@lasswell1941]:

  1. a **wide application spectrum** [e. g., @roessler2017, p. 14; @oehmer_et_al2023a, part II to V],
  2. a tendency to generate **"atheoretical work"** [@evans_et_al1995], and
  3. a **lack of infrastructures** for collaboration, sharing and/or overview [e. g., @heft_et_al2023, pp. 356-357; @oehmer_et_al2023b].
  
While in fact the first characteristic is considered to be a strength of the method, it promotes at the same time the questionable or lacking links between empirical studies and broader theories and hampers the generation of common infrastructures. Consequently, exhausting the methods potentials, as it is currently understood and done, leads to a scattering of empirical studies which also means that the conceptualised operationalisations and the used instruments as well as the achieved findings often remain isolated or only loosely interconnected within the area. This circumstance is not only problematic in terms of efficiency but moreover inconsistent with the scientific principle or claim of cumulative knowledge production [e. g., @freese1972; @parsons1954, p. 350]. This becomes particularly obvious when various content analyses are reviewed under a more general social question than can be typically answered in singular studies. One of these overarching interests directly emerging from the self-conception of the respective research community in Germany to contribute to the explanation of the "reciprocal relationship between communication, media and society" [@dgpuk2008] is the probing question of the relationship between mass media and societal, thus, political decision-making.

In this regard, there are several theories looking at the societal role of (mass) media, such as McCombs and Shaw's [@-mccombs_et_al1972] theory of agenda-setting, the theory of medialisation [e. g., @imhof2006; @meyen2009; @neuberger2016], or the cultivation hypothesis brought forward by Gerbner [e. g., -@gerbner1969] to name a few examples. What most of them have in common is a general constructivist perspective from which mass media constructs a certain type of reality by selection and presentation [e. g., @brosius_et_al1995] and, typically pressuming a functional differentiation of modern societies [see also e. g., @gerhards1991; @schimank2001], shapes a society's shared reality [e. g., @luhmann1995, p. 5]. Furthermore, within in the community it is also (nearly) common sense that media depictions do not just affect the societal environments they are embedded in, but are similarly influenced by them as well. Most of all they depend on information from other societal systems like politics, economy or science, which they acquire through observation of and/or correspondence with representatives (individuals, organisations, institutions) of these other systems. Thus, mass media, particularly traditional journalism, is often, and also in this work, conceptualised as "autonomous observer" [@kohring1997, p. 217] of the society. This means that the contents included in media coverage are - in various degrees - simultaneously reflecting and constructing societal processes.

This bidirectional function of mass media is especially valued in democratic societies where media is also oftentimes understood as "fourth estate" [e. g., @altmeppen_et_al1998]. In this context, it is presumed that many of the media contents are reflecting (and constructing) public exchange between societal actors who are authorised with political power and other societal actors (stakeholders, audience) that (ideally) legitimise their power and the resulting decisions. This normative basis of democracies was especially described by the German sociologist Jürgen Habermas [-@habermas1990; -@habermas1998] who described this mutual negotiation of decisions that affect a whole society between actors in different positions with the term "discourse". Accordingly, media coverage that mirrors or moderates such debates can be described as "media discourse". Thus, analysing not only media content, but understanding public discourses that are reflected in the media are a central interest of many communication scientists.

Nevertheless, as previously indicated, trying to meet this research interest and provide an answer to the overarching question of characteristics of public media discourses is with respect to the current content analytical practices and the resulting scattering and incomparability of existing empirical studies nearly impossible. However, the question is to big (and dynamic) to be answered in one single study or even a whole singular research project. Therefore the here reported PhD project is not aiming at ultimately or preliminary answering this question. Rather, by focussing on the more specific subdomain of technoscientific reporting central to science communication studies as an example, it is devoted to developing a framework for a more comparable and, therefore also, efficient content analytical research on media discourses, including a theoretical basis as well as overarchingly applicable and accessible (partly automated) instruments. All phases of the project are therefore motivated by the hope of contributing to a research environment, where singular study results contribute step by step to a profound understanding of media's role in constructing and transmitting public discourses and thus, bring the community closer to find satisfying answers to one of its central questions.

To do so, this report documents the whole PhD project including its theoretical foundations and conceptualisations as well as the development of concrete operationalisations, instruments and infrastructures and their application and evaluation in several exemplary studies. Therein, three published papers and/or submitted manuscripts associated with each phase of the PhD project are knitted together in this document and enriched with further background information that could not be included (in detail) in the papers. Thus, the remaining report encompasses a total of seven chapters that are subsumed under four parts that each accompanies one phase of the whole research project. Starting from scratch, the first chapter is dealing more profoundly with the aforementioned assumptions explaining the relevance of the project. Thus, it shall provide a well-explained and empirically supported answer to the questions of why it is worth it to analyse technoscientific media coverage and if and where there is room or need for improvement. For the critical and empirical discussion of the relevance-founded assumptions, results from a systematic review of the research area [@lueders2025] are mainly reported in this chapter.  A crucial second part of preparing the project was then thorough theoretical work. As this is one of the main criticism towards current research practices raised here, well-defined, comprehensible and/or justifiable conceptualisations of the central objects of research are expected to be the bar this whole project is fundamentally measured against. Thus, the second chapter aims at addressing **technoscientific media discourses** on an elaborate theoretical basis. Based on the questions of what can be described as **technoscientific** media coverage and how to define **media discourse**, an understanding of the concept encompassing four conditions which need to be fulfilled in order to analyse such technoscientific media discourses by means of content analysis is proposed. Finally, this concept is narrowed down to concrete so-called *technoscientific media discourse types* (in the following only referred to as "discourse types") by connecting theoretical considerations with empirical insights from the aformentioned review [@lueders2025]. Moving to the next phase of the project, these theoretical concepts were then operationalised in a modular way and corresponding instruments (further) developed. Focussing on the task of data collection, the development of the modular codebook by, for example, reviewing applied instruments and/or investigated characteristics in existing studies is reported and its core as well as (some) discourse-type-specific modules are introduced and explained (chapter 3). Additionally, chapter 4 is dedicated to a small excursus on automatisation, computer-/or app-based data collection and associated requirements and challenges regarding open and reproducible research as some of the core variables included in the modular codebook are/can be collected automatically and/or app-based which improves efficiency and allows for an upscaling of general/"basic", discourse-structural content analyses. The associated and (further) developed app-based and automated tools are, thus, also introduced in this chapter. Following that, the third project phase to test and evaluate the developed theoretical and methodological framework on a larger scale is presented, mainly building upon a paper/manuscript [@lueders2_sobald_vorhanden] where results from multiple explorative, thus descriptive, content analyses of various exemplary technoscientific media discourse types were comparatively summarised. Due to the operationalisation of media discourse in chapter 2, this chapter does not only include and discuss classical descriptive methods of data analysis, but also applies methods for the analysis of co-presence and clusters of interaction in media discourses which have been recently proposed by [@seeberger_et_al_sobald_vorhanden] in a paper/preprint/submitted manuscript. The goal of the last project phase was then to assess whether the proposed framework might also contribute to the detection of patterns that are stable within particular discourse types and thus, probably characteristic for them. Consequently, the second to last chapter summarises and discusses the results of multiple hypothesis-driven content analytical enquiries of technoscientific media coverage assigned to various discourse types [@lueders3_sobald_vorhanden], until the complete project and its contribution to the research area is finally critically reviewed and transferred to an outlook for future content analytical research on media discourse structures in the last concluding chapter of the presented work.

# Part I: Preparing systematic content analytical research on technoscientific media discourses {#sec-I}

The first chapter of this report takes a look at the preparation of systematic content analytical research on technoscientific media discourses. According to the ideal research process of social sciences [e. g., @frueh2017, pp. 90-95; @roessler2017, p. 38], it is, therefore, focussed on elaborating the relevance, goals and conditions - in summary, the epistemological interest - of a research project during the so-called "context of discovery"^[Translation of the German term "Entdeckungszusammenhang"] as well as the thorough reporting of the current state of research and theory building in the "context of justification"^[Translation of the German term "Begründungszusammenhang"]. Thus, in the first section of the chapter, the relevance of a common theoretical and methodological framework for content analyses on technoscientific media coverage will be explained through a systematic review of a sample of 371 existing empirical studies conducted at the beginning of the PhD project in 2025 *and published as single-author paper in Journal in Jahr*. As an expansion and reaction to this study, the second section of the chapter is devoted to answering one of the assumed and investigated explanations for the in the first part of the chapter extracted scattering of current relevant scientific publications, namely weak or lacking theoretical embeddings of empirical studies [see also @evans_et_al1995; @parsons1954, p. 350]. Accordingly, it is focused on the theoretical derivation of concept of **technoscientific media discourses** as adequate background for content analytical studies on corresponding media coverage. However, as will also be shown throughout this theory building section, the proposed theoretical framework is only one of many possibilities and not fitting for all kinds of technoscientific media coverage or questions and research interests directed at similar public mass (media) communication^[other theoretical embeddings might be for example derived from other theories in communication science, e. g., agenda-setting, medialisation, other social sciences like sociology or humanities, e. g., STS studies, (science) philosophy...].

## I.1 Epistemological relevance: Current investigation of technoscientific media coverage {#sec-I_1}

As previously mentioned, following the ideal path of social research, thoroughly considering the relevance, goals and contexts of a research project is essential before the start of the "actual" empirical research as they fundamentally define the frame in which adequate methods can be developed and results can be interpreted [@frueh2017, p. 71]. Thus, it is indispensable for the research process to have an early idea of what the scientific enquiry shall deliver, that is, which gap of knowledge shall be made smaller or closed and/or which problem(s) shall be addressed. Even though Früh [-@frueh2017, p. 71] emphasizes that scientific research does not always have to deal with "world-shaking problems"^[Translation of the original German quote: "weltbewegende Probleme"], the intended gain in knowledge should be somehow meaningful, for example, for the respective research community. Looking at the community in communication science, such meaning can be attributed to research motivated by "the essential communication issues of our time" [@sawyeroj] that are derived from an "outstanding importance of communication and media in societies"^[Translation of the original German quote: "herausragende Stellenwert, den Kommunikation und Medien in der Gesellschaft haben"] [@dgpuk2008]. However, further explaining the specific type of communication, namely journalistic media coverage^[provided no other comment, the term "media coverage" is in this report referring to professional/journalistic mass media reporting] on technology or science examined in the presented research project, and its relevance to society and/or communication science is firstly aimed at in this section. Secondly, the current state of research on the contents of this type of media coverage will be presented and problems as well as potentials of the present research practice are named. Tied together, these sub-sections justify the epistemological relevance of the PhD project to develop a framework for more comparable, potentially cumulative content analytical research on media coverage of science and technology.

### I.1.1 Why is technoscientific media coverage worthy of investigation? {#sec-I_1_1}

The question why it is relevant to examine media coverage of science and technology is strictly speaking combining two questions that need to be answered first: 1) Why is **media coverage** worthy of investigation? and 2) Why is media coverage of **science and technology** relevant?

Starting with media coverage in general, first of all a precision of the term "media coverage" as it is used throughout this report is necessary. Hence, here the term only refers to professional, that is journalistic, examinations with certain topics on mass media platforms, typically in newspapers, but other forms of mass media such as television or online media are at this stage^[in the empirical phase of the project media coverage was restricted to *traditional/textual mass media (news papers/online news papers?)*, further explanation of that decision is provided in *chapter 3*] not excluded. Thus, to explain the relevance of such media coverage, it is useful to take a look at the function of journalism in modern societies.

In this context, three keywords seem especially eye-catching in a macroscopic sense^[There are also many other keywords and theoretical considerations applied or appliable to journalim (research), a good German overview is for example provided in "Handbuch Journalismustheorien" edited by Martin Löffelholz and Liane Rothenberger [-@loeffelholz_et_al2024]]: **constructivism**, **function/service system** and **normative expectations**.

Within communication science the **constructivist basic position** that reality is not directly cognisable, but constructed through communicative processes or products (e. g., language [e. g., @weber2024], news media [e. g., @schulz1976]) is widespread [@hepp_et_al2017, p. 183]. Building on that, mass media is in various theoretical traditions conceptualised as (co-)producer of or platform to discuss and agree on societally shared and accepted reality constructions [see also @kepplinger2011]. One often-used theoretical framework based on constructivism is the sociological systems theory, in which mass media and/or journalism are described as so-called **function or service systems** of the society or public [e. g., @bloebaum2024; @kohring1997; @gerhards_et_al1990]. From that perspective, mass media is one of several systems that constitute a modern, functionally differentiated society [e. g., @luhmann1987]. Therein, functional differentiation is basically a description of collective task sharing in a macroscopic sense, which means that definable parts of a society - the function systems - are devoted to solve certain societal problems to maintain its functioning. To do so, each system has evolved an own logic of operation, the so-called function code, to reduce the complexity of societal problems through selection and enable the finding of solutions. For example, the science system deals with aspects of societal problems that focus on knowledge (or "truth"), while the economy focusses on money and the legal system on questions of justice. Thus, each system deals with different problems or - as primarily focussed here - addresses the same problem in a different manner. Consequently, each system constructs its own selective reality of a complex problem. Yet, it is never independent of its environment (the other systems), already because an adequate addressing of societal issues through task sharing requires a subsequent compilation of relevant selective solutions from various systems as parts of the solution to the whole problem, but also because the processes in one system can always have intended or unintended consequences for other systems. Accordingly, function systems need to observe their environment as well as themselves to adapt to external changes and expectations, but also to develop own expectations for their environment to maintain their functionality [see @kohring1997, pp. 243-245]. At that point, the action enabling complexity reduction through system-specific selection becomes a problem for the systems since the reality constructions and entangled results of each system are not immediately comprehensible for its environment and the systems itself do not have the structures and resources to find and translate these potentially relevant external viewpoints to accordingly react to them. Furthermore, singular systems are not able to compile external reality constructions and associated solutions for a shared/splitted problem without falling back to their own function code. However, such a "neutral" reconstruction of the complexity of a problem is necessary to find overarching societal solutions in modern democracies [e. g., @habermas1998]. Therefore, societies need not only a system that detects and collects all available, related system-specific viewpoints and solutions, but also translates and transmits this information (back) to every involved system. That is where mass media comes in and what led the influential German sociologist Niklas Luhmann [-@luhmann1995, p. 5] to his often-quoted statement: "What we know about our society [...], we know through mass media."^[Translation of the original German quote: "Was wir über unsere Gesellschaft [...] wissen, wissen wir durch die Massenmedien."]
In the existing theoretical literature it is a bit ambiguous whether journalism and/or mass media^[the terms are used interchangeably in the following] itself serves as a societal *function system* [e. g., @bloebaum2024] or whether it has to be described as a *service system* subordinated to the function system of the so-called public [@kohring1997]. Nevertheless, the differences between both approaches are not that big and thus, neglectable at this point. While for example Blöbaum [-@bloebaum2024, p. 125] describes journalism^[Not that his as well as Kohring's [-@kohring1997] descriptions focus on a specific (probably the most widespread and traditional) form of journalism, namely information or news journalism. Therefore, they are not necessarily adequate fo rother forms of journalism, like entertainment journalism.] as function system committed to the function code of information, Kohring [-@kohring1997, p. 252] describes a function system which he calls "the public" that applies the code of "multiple-system affiliation"^[Translation of the German term "Mehrsystemzugehörigkeit] to which journalism serves as *service system* by using the same logic of operation. Regardless of whether journalism is a function or a service system, it has evolved structures and procedures to address the previously explained societal problem of mediating between various systems and externally compiling related information from different systems. This bridging function is achieved through constant observation of the societal environment for new events and selecting and comprehensibly present only those which are informative for the society, that is events that are relevant for more systems than the one they originated from. Even though the generation of (normative) expectations itself are explicitly excluded from descriptive social theories such as systems theory, the mere description of the societal function of journalism and mass media implies the societal importance and special status of it. It is therefore not surprising that Filipović and Ulrich [-@filipovic_et_al2024, p. 302] describe journalism as "action field with a specific normativity"^[Translation of the original German quote: "Handlungsfeld mit einer spezifischen Normativität"]. Typically **normative expectations** towards journalism are tightly connected to overarching societal norms that can be derived from the political structures and principles of different states. So, comparative theories and studies on media systems [e. g., @brueggemann_et_al2014; @hallin_et_al2004; @siebert_et_al1963] have already suggested that the political contexts in which mass media is embedded influences the structures and processes of mass media leading to different types of media systems. Focussing exclusively on democratic societies, as in this report through its later main focus on media coverage in modern Germany, Strömbäck [-@stroembaeck2005] has worked out normative implications for journalism depending on the concrete model of democracy building the foundation of a society. According to him, in *procedural democracies*, which are basically societies that fulfill the minimal standards to be described as democracies, the only expectation towards citizens and politicians is to respect the democratic principles, but not to make use of them. Accordingly, the only normative implications towards journalism are respecting the democratic principles as well and acting as a watchdog to expose acts threatening these basic principles. On the contrary, in *participatory* and *deliberative democracies* journalism is expected to enable the participation of citizens in political decision-making processes by not only informing and mobilising them in a top-down manner, but also serving as a bottom-up "speaking tube" and/or platform to foster rational and equal discussions between various stakeholders, citizens and decision-makers striving for consensus [see also @habermas1998].

Taking together these considerations on the societal function of journalism, the contents of (information) journalistic mass media coverage are worthy of investigation as they can provide valuable insights in the handling of societal problems, especially pointing to the exchange of reality constructions and potential solutions between various societal systems, represented through stakeholders, and the political decision-making process. Further reflections on this connection of media coverage and democratic decision-making will be presented in @sec-I_2 focussing on the description of media coverage as discourse.

Now, after having outlined why journalistic mass media coverage is worthy of scientific investigation, in the context of this research project there is also a need for justification of focussing on a specific type of journalistic reporting, namely the coverage of science and technology. While further reflections on which aspects of science and technology (results, products, consequences, astonishment, achievements...) can become subjects of media discourse and whether they are best called "issues", "topics" or otherwise will be carried out in @sec-I_2, in this section the more general, but closely related role of science and technology in and for society is reviewed at this point to explain why science and technology focussed media coverage is an interesting and thus, valuable object of research - not only in the sciences of science communication (as will also be shown in the following results from the carried-out systematic review @sec-I_1_2).

Starting from scratch and already mentioned in passing, science^[for better readability, without other specification the single term "science" will always include technology in the following] can be also conceptualised as a function system in modern societies according to systems theory. Its primary societal function and thus, also its self-sustaining purpose is the pursuit of truth, or (maybe less normatively loaded) knowledge. Consequently, the information generated within the science system is always generated with respect to its potential to (better) explain observed phenomena that are considered to be part of a shared, societal reality which can be better dealt with (e. g., managed or endured) the more extensive and detailed it is understood. However, as explained earlier, due to this functional differentiation, other aspects of this shared reality relevant for the system's environment (e. g., the clarification of legal or moral questions) are pragmatically excluded from sciences as the processes and methods, which were/are all developed respecting this specific function code, are not able to answer these questions^[Yet, the questions itself or the provided answers can become objects of scientific enquiry, for example in legal or political sciences]. Nevertheless, this purposeful orientation of science does not lead to a total exclusion of normativity from the system which was also heavily debated in the so-called "Werturteilsstreit" prominently featured by the German sociologist Max Weber [e. g., @weber1988]. Thus, to reach the overarching goal of approaching truth by intersubjective, standardised - colloquially probably rather described as "objective" or neutral - knowledge generation, scientific principles such as, for example, the Mertonian [-@merton1942] norms of universalism, communism, disinterestedness and organised scepticism or Karl Popper's principle of falsification (see @keuth2019, p. 54-55) have evolved and often build the foundation of normative, societal expectations towards science.
