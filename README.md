# content_analysis_scitech_discourses
This repository contains materials associated with my PhD project that aims at developing a more comparable and standardised procedure to enquire media discourses on technoscientific issues by means of content analysis. Associated large files, such as dataframes etc., are stored in FigShare.
The created package called "actordupes" that contains the three functions needed to clean NER actor dataframes regarding duplicates is stored in the GitHub repository "actordupes".
